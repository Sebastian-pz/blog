      "I created a FullStack web application that manages the sales, costs, expenses, and inventories of a bar, thus facilitating the store's processes.",

      "Initially, in November, due to a mutual acquaintance, I was contacted to inquire about certain administrative processes of the bar in question. During my observations, I was told that they were creating specific software for sales management (as I mentioned in a previous blog post).",

      "Since the software was already being built, my involvement in the process was limited to creating an Excel spreadsheet to temporarily solve the sales and inventory management problem. However, by the end of November, early December, I was given the remaining project information.",

      "The bar's idea was to have custom software developed for their unique management needs. However, they were being sold a license for pre-made software, and they were being charged a significantly high monthly fee (I'm not sure if it's appropriate to mention the exact amount). Things were already going wrong: they were being charged for the application and the monthly license, which added up to a large sum of money.",

      "Additionally, during the 'delivery' of the software, they were told that to run the application, they would need to install Windows on their computer (they use a MacBook Pro in the business). This led to the business owner feeling uncomfortable with the situation.",

      "To keep it short, after that conversation with the other software provider, I was approached, and by the following Monday, I started working on the project.",

      "Stack used for this project were mainly TypeScript, NodeJS, React, Vite, Tailwind, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB (Atlas), byCrypt, JSON web tokens (JWT), Cors, and ESLint with standard to improve the code.",

      "This is a short post sharing my personal thoughts on working with TDD, but before diving into that, let's first explain what TDD is:",
      "|subtitle| What is TDD?",
      "Test-Driven Development is a programming practice that involves writing tests (usually unit tests) first, then writing the code to make those tests pass, and finally refactoring the written code. (Herranz, J. 2023)",
      "|image|https://images.spiceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/29095630/How-TDD-Works.png",
      "Image sourced from: SpiceWorks.com",

      "|subtitle| My Opinion on Working with Test-Driven Development",
      "Recently, I worked on a project using TDD methodology, and it gave me some insight into why this methodology is so polarizing within the community.",
      "I've firsthand heard the opinion that 'writing tests is tedious because I know my code works when I write it.' And I understand that, but from my perspective, tests aren't just for yourself; they're meant to help your colleague (or yourself in the future) who might need to modify the code and ensure they aren't breaking anything.",
      "The primary purpose of Test-Driven Development isn't just to help you write code (though it does), it wants to ensure that future changes don't affect the overall functionality of the application. It's a safeguard to prevent changes from breaking everything.",
      "For example, let's say you worked on a feature to schedule users in a calendar, and it works perfectly. But tomorrow, you're asked to change the user schema. Both features work perfectly on their own, but when you integrate them, you might find it doesn't compile. Maybe the change in the user schema affected the scheduling process‚Äîperhaps a property, maybe a state, or anything else. TDD helps you foresee these issues.",
      "Working with TDD means more development time, questioning whether 'the code works anyway,' and dealing with the pressure to deliver. But it helps develop more robust, scalable code and makes your teammates's jobs easier (or your own in the future) by avoiding bugs.",
      "Yes, it's more code, but it's worth it.",
      "|note| Note: It should be clarified that using TDD or not is a specific decision to each project. Some projects will benefit from it, while others may not. It's not a golden rule that must always be followed.",

      "Using named functions within the useEffect hook in React sounds a bit... odd, doesn't it? Well, not for Cory House.",
      "Not long ago, I saw a post on X discussing the use of named functions within the useEffect hook in React (yes, as the first parameter). The idea intrigued me, so I delved into the thread to see what people had to say about it.",
      "It's a way to improve code readability, making it easier to understand what a useEffect is doing in our application. And yes, from this perspective, it makes sense. However, it didn't convince everyone, with some arguing that it complicates development.",
      "On one hand, we have the readability aspect (which, yes, is more readable from my point of view). On the other hand, we have to consider conventions‚Äîit's much more common to see this hook used with a simple arrow function as a parameter. So, I understand the clash of opinions on this topic.",
      "Some people say that a simple comment explaining what the useEffect does solves everything. In other words, comment VS naming the function, to which the author of the post responds with the following:",
      "‚úÖ Code tends to stay up to date, whereas comments often become outdated. Therefore, comments 'lie' more frequently than code.",
      "‚úÖ Named functions improve stack tracking, enhancing debugging and error logging.",
      "‚úÖ Comments should not replace a function name; they should complement the function name in exceptional cases where the name alone is not sufficient.",
      "There are also those who complain that now, thanks to this change, useEffects become too complex... Finding the right name for a function is harder than it seems ü§£.",
      "As for me, I think I prefer to continue using an arrow function with an inner function that I'll call later. It may not be the most optimal solution, but I find it quite decent and readable ü§Ø.",
      "Credits to Cory House @housecor on X, where I saw this post.",
      "What is your opinion on this? Is it better to use named functions or stick with typical arrow functions?",

      "Primarily focused on tech posts and updates about my projects, the blog is almost complete. There are just a few final touches left, but the overall functionality and details of the application are already finished.",

      "The creation of the application started in the first week of November 2023 and progressed gradually. After finishing my academic term at university, the project was almost entirely complete; in fact, only the styling details were left to finalize.",

      "Initially, there was no estimate of the development time required for this blog. Being so close to the final exam periods made budgeting somewhat uncertain.",

      "Finally, as of today, November 16, 2023, the project is practically finished.",
